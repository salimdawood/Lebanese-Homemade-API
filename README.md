# Lebanese Homemade Platform - API

U can find the front-end platform [here](https://github.com/salimdawood/Lebanese-Homemade-Frontend).

## Overview

A developer's main work is to find a real world problem and build the solution. Many people from my country(Lebanon) started small businesses as a way to supplement their income as the economic crisis hit. Advertising their products using paid ads or promotions is a real challenge for these small startups, my platform is a free solution for them. `User` can create a profile and start creating cards that contain information about their business(location,social media links) and products(menu,photos) while `Guest` can browse this platform with filter functionality by categories to find their best product with the desired price.

I used ASP.NET CORE for building the WEB API due to the light weight and simplicity this web framework can provide. This was my first ReactJs project dealing with API and state management at this scale. This caused in implementing some features in a different way and not following the best practices. Many features can be easily added  such as `hashed passwords`, `middleware`, and `more secured endpoints`.
